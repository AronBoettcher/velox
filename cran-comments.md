## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Replaced all variable-length arrays in the C++ code with std vectors (which conform to the C++ ISO standard).

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 14.04 install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 14.04 server (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* Maintainer: 'Philipp Hunziker <hunzikp@gmail.com>'
  New submission

  This is, indeed, my first submission.
